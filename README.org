* A simple FAST detector
Using Libav, pthread and SDL I was able to implement a simple FAST detector
that given an arbitrary video it compute the FAST algorithm on every frame,
showing the result in a window:

- Top right corner: current frame
- Bottom right corner: current frame with the FAST algorithm applied
- Top left corner: previous frame
- Bottom right corner: previous frame with the FAST algorithm applied 

The frame with the FAST algorithm applied have a gray background because
when it detect a pixel I have calculated the score/color using the sum
of all the point in the 3 radius circle of the feature point
